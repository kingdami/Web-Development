    <p align="left" class="objective"> This is the story all about how my life got twisted upside down and I will like to take a minute just sit right there and let me tell you how I became the prince of a town called Belaire.
In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
